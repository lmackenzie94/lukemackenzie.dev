I'm currently building this site purely for learning purposes. I was curious to try out Supabase and explore some of the newer Next.js features (app router, parallel/intercepting routes, React server components & actions, etc.). Since I didn't want to spend too much time on styling, I opted for shadcn/ui which also allowed me to easily add toast notifications. Authentication is handled by Supabase (via the @supabase/ssr package), which was a breeze to set up and use.
