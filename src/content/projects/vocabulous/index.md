Want a fabulous vocabulary? Vocabulous is the app for you! Build your vocabulary one word at a time. Add new words, review definitions, and practice until mastery.

I was curious to try out **Supabase** and explore some of the newer **Next.js** features (app router, React server components & actions, etc.). Since I didn't want to spend too much time on styling, I opted for **shadcn/ui** which also allowed me to easily add toast notifications. Authentication is handled by Supabase (via the **@supabase/ssr** package), which was a breeze to set up and use.
