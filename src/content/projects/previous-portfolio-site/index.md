My main goal when building this site was to not only continue growing my knowledge of React and Gatsby but to also explore some new stuff like ThemeUI, Sanity.io, and Custom NPM Packages. As you can see in the second picture, I've created a completely custom Sanity.io CMS for my site that includes, among other things, a Live Preview of changes (accomplished by running the dev server on a Heroku dyno) and automatic deployment to Netlify.
