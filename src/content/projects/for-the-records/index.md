I'd been wanting to build this site for a while and finally decided to go for it using **Astro** on the front-end and **Payload** as the CMS. ÔªøAll parts of this project, including the database, live on a DigitalOcean droplet. I decided to setup the droplet from scratch which meant doing everything from installing & configuring NGINX and Node.js, to setting up Postgres and adding a basic firewall. It was definitely a learning experience and I'm sure it's not perfect but HEY, it works! ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The site is automatically built & deployed on push to the repo via Buddy CI.
